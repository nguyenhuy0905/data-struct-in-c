# Data structure in C, third try
- My third attempt to write C in a OOP way.
- Why? I don't know. Maybe the extra challenge is nicer than just using C++ and call it a day.
### What
- This time, it's not just "data structures". You can say it's pretty much OOP.
---
### Plans
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Implement some more types as Object
