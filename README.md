>Anyways, this is my attempt to write data structures in C. 
 ### Why not C++?
 - I don't know C++. And besides, C++ is already designed for this kind of stuff. How about we try something more,
difficult? To be fair, I think C is actually simpler.

### What have you written?
- Linked list.

### What are you planning to write?
- Resizable array.
- Stack, (priority) queue (which basically is linked list)
- Hash (map, set)
- Tree (BST, Red-Black)
- Heap (maybe)
- Graph (undirected, directed, unweighted, weighted)
