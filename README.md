>Anyways, this is my attempt to write data structures in C. 
 ### Why not C++?
 - I don't know C++. And besides, C++ is already designed for this kind of stuff. How about we try something more,
difficult? To be fair, I think C is actually simpler.

### NOTE:
- The data structures ONLY stores integers. This is to ensure caching is working properly. 
- I may be overly wary about performance though.

### What have you written?
- Linked list.
- Queue.

### What are you planning to write?
- Resizable array.
- Stack, priority queue (which basically are linked list)
- Hash (map, set)
- Tree (BST, Red-Black)
- Heap (maybe)
- Graph (undirected, directed, unweighted, weighted)

### NOTE
- Second attempt, after I have learned, stuff.

### PLANS
- [ ] Implement linked list **on the way**
- [ ] Implement stack and queue
- [ ] Implement binary tree
- [ ] Implement AVL tree
- [ ] Implement red-black tree (not guaranteed I would do though)
- [ ] Implement a simple hash map
- [ ] Implement graph
